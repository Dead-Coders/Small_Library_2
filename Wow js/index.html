        In word processing and desktop publishing, a hard return or paragraph
        break indicates a new paragraph, to be distinguished from the soft
        return at the end of a line internal to a paragraph. This distinction
        allows word wrap to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without
        losing paragraph breaks. The software may apply vertical white space or
        indenting at paragraph breaks, depending on the selected style. How such
        documents are actually stored depends on the file format. For example,
        HTML uses the
        <p>
          tag as a paragraph container. In plaintext files, there are two common
          formats. The pre-formatted text will have a newline at the end of
          every physical line, and two newlines at the end of a paragraph,
          creating a blank line. An alternative is to only put newlines at the
          end of each paragraph, and leave word wrapping up to the application
          that displays or processes the text. A line break that is inserted
          manually, and preserved when re-flowing, may still be distinct from a
          paragraph break, although this is typically not done in prose. HTML's
          <br />
          tag produces a line break without ending the paragraph; the W3C
          recommends using it only to separate lines of verse (where each
          "paragraph" is a stanza), or in a street address.[6]
